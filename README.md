Technical Plan for an AI Agent to Process Emergency Incident Data (EIDO)
Introduction
Emergency responders and security teams need timely, consolidated information from multiple reports to make quick decisions. The Emergency Incident Data Object (EIDO) is a standardized JSON format defined by NENA for sharing incident information across systems​
NAYLORNETWORK.COM
. We propose a Python-based AI agent that ingests police reports in EIDO format, uses both current and historical incident data to summarize the situation, decides whether a new report represents a new incident or an update to an existing one, analyzes how incidents grow over time and spread geographically, and recommends appropriate response actions (e.g. alerting students, contacting police, dispatching an ambulance). This document outlines a batch-mode proof-of-concept design (processing incidents in batches or sequentially), with considerations for future real-time streaming. The solution will leverage a combination of structured data processing, geospatial analysis, and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning to fulfill these needs. We detail the architecture, component choices, LLM selection, and a one-week implementation timeline.
Key Requirements
The AI agent must address the following core tasks:
Ingest EIDO JSON Reports: Parse structured JSON police reports formatted as EIDOs. This includes validating the JSON against the EIDO schema and extracting key fields (incident type, time, location, description, etc.)​
NAYLORNETWORK.COM
 for processing.
Summarize Emergency Events: Aggregate and summarize information about an emergency using the current report and historical EIDOs. The agent should produce a concise incident synopsis that captures key details from multiple related reports (an incident timeline or accumulated summary).
Incident Correlation (New or Update): Determine if an incoming report pertains to a new incident (requiring creation of a new EIDO record) or an existing incident (requiring an update to the ongoing incident's EIDO). This may involve comparing the new report’s details with active incidents to find matches by location, time, or narrative.
Trend Analysis – Growth & Geography: Track how each incident evolves over time (content growth through subsequent updates) and how incidents spread geographically. The agent should be able to analyze trends such as the increase in information (more fields filled, updates added) and expansion of the incident’s location or the overall geographic distribution of incidents.
Recommended Response Actions: Based on the incident classification or summary, suggest appropriate responses (e.g. issue a campus alert, dispatch police units, send an ambulance). These recommendations should align with the severity and nature of the incident.
In addition, the proof-of-concept will include an interactive web interface (using Streamlit or Dash) for demonstration and FastAPI endpoints to simulate integration with external systems (e.g. receiving new reports via an API). We will use open-source or accessible LLMs (such as QwQ-32B or DeepSeek-R1 variants) for the reasoning and summarization tasks, ensuring the AI agent can be deployed without proprietary models. Basic geocoding integration is needed to convert location fields into coordinates for mapping and geographic analysis.
Proposed Architecture
The system will be designed as a modular pipeline of components, each responsible for part of the workflow. In batch mode, the agent will process a list of EIDO JSON reports sequentially (simulating a stream of incident reports). For each report, it will parse the data, match it to an incident, update summaries, analyze trends, and produce any alerts or recommendations. The design is modular to facilitate easy replacement or upgrading of components (for example, swapping in a more powerful LLM or a real database in the future). Figure 1 outlines the main components of the architecture:
Module	Responsibility	Implementation
EIDO Ingestion	Read and validate EIDO JSON; convert to Python objects	Use Pydantic data models or dataclasses; Python json library for parsing
Incident Matching	Determine if report maps to an existing incident or new	Compare identifiers if present; else use similarity (embedding via vector DB) and rules
Summarization & Update	Summarize incident details combining new info with history	LLM-based text generation (via LangChain & open-source LLM)​
PYTHON.LANGCHAIN.COM
; maintain running incident summary
Geographic Analysis	Geocode addresses; track location changes and incident spread	Geopy Nominatim for geocoding​
GEOPY.READTHEDOCS.IO
; compute distance or area expansion; map coordinates
Response Recommendation	Classify incident type/severity and suggest actions	Rule-based mapping of incident type to actions, supplemented by LLM reasoning for nuanced cases
Data Storage	Store incidents and updates for reference	In-memory store (Python dict / list) or lightweight DB (SQLite) for demo; consider vector index for similarity search
API Interface	Receive new reports; output results to external systems	FastAPI endpoints (e.g. /ingest_report, /get_incident) returning JSON summaries or recommendations
Web Interface	Interactive demo UI for analysts to view and test agent	Streamlit app (or Dash) to upload data, display incident summaries, maps, and recommended actions
Data Flow: When a new EIDO report arrives, the EIDO Ingestion module parses the JSON into a structured object. The Incident Matching logic then checks if this report is part of an existing incident: it may use a unique incident ID in the report (if provided) or compute a similarity score with ongoing incidents based on location proximity and textual similarity of descriptions. For similarity matching, we plan to generate embeddings of the incident description (using a sentence-transformer or the LLM embedding model) and query a vector store (e.g., FAISS) for nearest incidents. If a match above a certain confidence threshold is found, the report is linked as an update to that incident; otherwise, a new incident record is created. The agent then invokes the Summarization & Update module: it assembles the current incident’s information (all reports so far, sorted by time) and prompts the LLM to produce an updated summary of the incident in clear natural language. This summary will evolve as more details come in, providing a concise narrative of what has happened. Next, the system uses a Geographic Analysis component to handle location data. If the EIDO contains an address or place name, we use a geocoder (such as Geopy’s Nominatim, which interfaces with OpenStreetMap) to get latitude/longitude​
GEOPY.READTHEDOCS.IO
. This allows plotting incidents on a map and measuring distances. For each incident, the agent can track if new reports add new locations (e.g., suspect moved to another site, or additional scenes of the same incident), thereby expanding the geographic scope. We can calculate metrics like the furthest distance between any two locations in the incident, or monitor the spread of incidents across a city over time (for trend analysis). In parallel, a Response Recommendation module considers the incident’s nature and summary to suggest actions. This can be partly rule-based (for example, an incident with type "Medical – cardiac arrest" triggers an ambulance dispatch by default). We will enhance this with LLM reasoning for nuanced situations: the LLM can be prompted with the incident summary and asked to list the appropriate emergency response steps. For example, for an “active shooter near campus” scenario, the LLM might recommend both “alert all students and staff via emergency notification” and “notify law enforcement immediately”, whereas for a “minor traffic accident” it might suggest “no widespread alert, just dispatch police to scene”. The open-source reasoning LLMs we use (described below) are capable of following instructions to output such targeted recommendations based on the context. Finally, the system interfaces with users and external systems through two fronts: an API interface and a Web interface. The FastAPI-based REST API will expose endpoints to simulate integration – e.g., an endpoint where an external system can POST a new EIDO JSON and receive back the incident ID and summary, or an endpoint to GET the current status of an incident (summary, number of reports, recommended actions). This mimics how a CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch) system or campus alert system might integrate with the agent. The web interface (Streamlit or Dash) will serve as an interactive dashboard in the demo. It will allow us to load a batch of EIDO reports, run the processing, and visualize the results. For instance, the Streamlit app can display a table of incidents with their summaries, a map with incident locations plotted, trend graphs (like number of incident updates over time), and the recommended actions for each incident. The UI will also enable testers to input custom JSON reports or toggle whether a given report is treated as new or part of an existing incident, to see how the agent reacts. Real-Time Considerations: While the POC operates in batch mode (processing a static set or a sequence of incidents on demand), the design anticipates real-time deployment. In a real-time system, incoming reports would trigger the pipeline immediately (e.g., via an event queue or webhook to the FastAPI service). The components remain the same, but we would ensure the LLM calls are handled asynchronously (to not block other reports), possibly using background worker processes or an async task queue (like Celery or FastAPI's BackgroundTasks). The state (incident store and vector index) would be updated atomically to handle concurrent updates. Also, for real-time use, persistent storage (a database for incidents and an up-to-date vector index for similarity search) would be needed instead of in-memory, to survive restarts and scale across multiple instances. The modular architecture makes it straightforward to swap the in-memory data structures with robust alternatives (SQL or NoSQL database for incident records, a scalable vector database service for embeddings, etc.) when moving to a production, real-time environment.
Technology Stack and Tools
To implement this agent, we will use a range of proven Python libraries and frameworks, ensuring rapid development within one week. Table 1 lists the key technologies and their role in the system:
Functionality	Recommended Libraries/Tools	Notes
LLM Integration	Hugging Face Transformers; LangChain	For loading open-source LLM models (e.g. QwQ, LLaMA) and managing prompts/chains​
UNIT42.PALOALTONETWORKS.COM
. LangChain provides connectors and orchestration for LLM calls and tool use.
Reasoning & Summarization	QwQ-32B, DeepSeek R1 Distill, or LLaMA 2 (see LLM section)	The AI models to perform natural language understanding, multi-report reasoning, and summary generation​
PYTHON.LANGCHAIN.COM
. Open-source models allow local or self-hosted use.
Embedding & Similarity	SentenceTransformers (e.g. all-MiniLM) or LLM embedding; FAISS	To convert incident text to vectors for similarity matching. FAISS can index vectors for efficient nearest-neighbor search to find related incidents.
Data Parsing & Validation	Pydantic or dataclasses; Python json	Pydantic can define an EIDO schema model, automatically validate JSON fields and types on load. EIDO fields (like incident time, type codes, location) become attributes for easy access.
Geocoding (Location)	Geopy (with Nominatim)​
GEOPY.READTHEDOCS.IO
Converts addresses or place names in EIDO to latitude/longitude coordinates using OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim (no API key required, open data). Also can do reverse geocoding if needed.
Distance & Area Calc	geopy.distance or shapely	To calculate distances between coordinates (for checking if new report is within X miles of an existing incident) and to measure geographic spread of incident locations.
Web Framework (API)	FastAPI	High-performance web framework to build RESTful API endpoints easily. Supports Pydantic models for data exchange (EIDO in/out) and async features for future real-time use.
Interactive UI	Streamlit (preferred) or Plotly Dash	Streamlit allows quick development of a web app with widgets to upload files, buttons to run analysis, and can display maps (via st.map for lat/long points) and charts. Dash could be used if more custom interactivity is needed, but Streamlit is faster for a demo.
Data Visualization	Plotly or Altair (integrated in Streamlit)	For plotting trends over time (e.g., count of incident updates by hour) or bar charts of incident types. Plotly can also render map scatter plots if needed.
Storage/Persistence	SQLite or In-Memory (Python dict/list)	During the demo, incidents and their summaries can be kept in memory. For persistence or larger scale, SQLite (via SQLAlchemy) can store incident records, and a JSON or Pickle file can store the vector index for reuse.
All the above libraries are open-source and widely used in the Python ecosystem, aligning with the project's openness. The combination of Transformers + LangChain simplifies working with LLMs by providing abstractions like chains (for summarization, QA, etc.) and memory​
UNIT42.PALOALTONETWORKS.COM
. We will use LangChain’s capabilities to structure the LLM prompts: for example, a chain that takes the new report and retrieves the relevant past incident notes, then feeds both into the LLM for summarization (this is essentially a form of retrieval-augmented generation). FastAPI and Streamlit are chosen for their ease of use and quick setup, enabling us to have a basic UI and API running in days. Geopy will handle our geospatial needs without requiring complex GIS setup, since it can directly call an external geocoding service in a simple manner.
LLM Model Selection and Comparison
Choosing the right Large Language Model is crucial, since it will be performing the heavy reasoning: interpreting report narratives, comparing them, and generating summaries/recommendations. We need an LLM that is capable of understanding structured input, handling multiple pieces of information (current and historical reports), and producing coherent, factual summaries and classifications. Key considerations include the model’s reasoning ability, size (which affects inference speed), context window (to handle concatenation of multiple reports if needed), and how easily it can be integrated (license and runtime compatibility with our stack). Recent advancements in open-source LLMs have produced models particularly strong in reasoning tasks. In fact, models like DeepSeek R1 and Alibaba’s QwQ-32B were specifically trained to excel at multi-step reasoning, rivaling some of OpenAI’s latest models​
BLOG.VITAL.AI
. Below is a comparison of a few candidate models:
Model	Size & Type	Strengths	Challenges	Integration
QwQ-32B (Alibaba Qwen-QwQ)	~32B parameters, Transformer decoder (chat optimized)	Open-source reasoning-specialized model; excels at chain-of-thought and complex logical tasks​

. Relatively smaller than 70B, making it somewhat easier to run with quantization.	Requires significant VRAM (32B may need ~20GB in 4-bit quantization). Tends to be verbose in its reasoning approach​
BLOG.VITAL.AI
, which might need prompt tuning to keep answers concise.	Available as GGUF/GGML for use with llama.cpp and via HuggingFace Transformers. Can be run locally on a high-end GPU or CPU (with quantization).

​
SEBASTIANRASCHKA.COM
. Able to handle complex multi-document analysis. Likely to produce very accurate and well-reasoned summaries and recommendations.	70B model is heavy – requires multi-GPU or ~140GB RAM in full precision (less if 4-bit quantized). Running locally is challenging, so might rely on server-grade hardware. Inference will be slower due to size.	Open-source (DeepSeek team provided distilled weights). Can integrate via HuggingFace (if weights available) or run with llama.cpp (quantized)​
BLOG.VITAL.AI
. Alternatively, DeepSeek offers a cloud API to use their large model via an OpenAI-compatible interface​
MEDIUM.COM
, which can simplify integration at the cost of relying on an external service.
LLaMA-2 Chat (13B)	13B parameters, Meta AI (chat-tuned)	Lightweight and fast. Can run on a single GPU (16 GB) or even on CPU with optimization. Good general understanding of language and instructions, suitable for basic summarization and classification.	Not specifically optimized for multi-step reasoning, so it may sometimes miss nuances linking multiple reports or require more guidance in prompts. Smaller context window (4k tokens) could limit how many EIDO records can be considered at once.	Easily integrated via HuggingFace Transformers (model is freely available). Many fine-tuned variants exist that could slightly improve performance. Serves as a baseline model if higher-end models are not feasible.
Recommendation: For the proof-of-concept, we recommend using QwQ-32B as the primary LLM, assuming we have access to a GPU machine or can run it quantized. QwQ offers a strong balance of advanced reasoning capability​
BLOG.VITAL.AI
 and manageability in deployment (32B is large but with 4-bit quantization and the efficiency of llama.cpp, it could potentially run on a single modern server). Its open availability and licensing make it suitable for an academic or pilot project. We will integrate QwQ using the HuggingFace Transformers library or LangChain’s LLM wrappers, which allow us to load the model and use it in a chat/instruction mode for prompt engineering. If hardware is a major constraint, an alternative is to utilize DeepSeek’s API service with their flagship model. DeepSeek R1 (or a variant) can be accessed through an API that mimics OpenAI’s API calls​
MEDIUM.COM
. This means we could simply call the API with our prompt (which includes the incident details) and get a completion with the summary or decision. The upside is we leverage a very powerful model without hosting it; the downside is reliance on an external service and potential latency costs. Still, as DeepSeek is an “accessible” LLM in the sense the user mentioned, it's a viable option if we treat the POC as a simulation of how a cloud model would be used in production. In implementation, we can abstract the LLM interface such that either a local model (QwQ via transformers) or an API call (DeepSeek or even OpenAI GPT-4) can be used, configured by a setting. This flexibility ensures we can fall back to a smaller local model (like LLaMA-2 13B) for quick tests, use QwQ for the final demo, and know that switching to DeepSeek API or another model later would not require major code changes. The chosen LLM will be prompted with a structured format to handle the JSON inputs. For example, we might format the prompt as:
Incident history: [brief summary or key data of existing incident or "None" if new]
New report details: [important fields from EIDO, like description, caller info, location]
Tasks: 1) Determine if this report is same incident as history or a new incident. 2) If same, update the incident summary; if new, provide a new incident summary. 3) Recommend appropriate response actions.
This prompt structure guides the model to perform reasoning step-by-step. The model’s chain-of-thought (especially for reasoning-optimized models) will internally consider the location/time matching and content overlap to decide linkage, then formulate a combined summary, and finally list responses. Using an open reasoning model is advantageous here, as it can follow these multi-part instructions and justify the linkage decision. Empirically, research and community reports indicate that such models (DeepSeek, QwQ) are capable of multi-step decision making needed for this agent​
MEDIUM.COM
. During development, we will refine prompts to ensure the outputs are reliable and factually grounded in the provided data (for instance, we’ll include instructions to not hallucinate any incident details beyond the EIDO input).
Implementation Timeline (One-Week Plan)
We propose a compressed development schedule to build this demo in one week. The work will be organized into milestones by day, focusing on one or two major components at a time:
Day 1: Project setup and data understanding. Define the EIDO schema using Pydantic models (or dataclasses) based on the NENA standard. Create a few sample EIDO JSON files (or use provided samples) to test the parsing. Begin setting up the development environment with required libraries (FastAPI, Streamlit, Transformers, etc.). Milestone 1: Basic EIDO ingestion – able to load a JSON file and instantiate an incident object in Python.
Day 2: Implement the Incident Matching logic. Start with a simple approach: if the EIDO has an incident ID field, use that. If not, implement a similarity check. This will involve integrating an embedding model (e.g., SentenceTransformer) and using cosine similarity or FAISS index to compare the new report's description with existing incidents’ descriptions. Also code the logic to either attach the report to an incident or create a new one. Milestone 2: Incident correlation working on sample inputs (we can simulate two reports with the same location and see if the system links them).
Day 3: Integrate the LLM for summarization and reasoning. Set up the chosen LLM (e.g., load QwQ-32B in 4-bit mode). Test a prompt for summarizing a single report first. Then extend to provide a prior incident summary + new details as prompt and see if it updates correctly. If the local LLM is too slow to iterate on, use a smaller proxy model or an API (like DeepSeek’s) for prompt development, then switch to the target model. Also, implement the recommended response generation (for now, possibly as part of the LLM’s output or a separate prompt). Milestone 3: Given some hard-coded incident history and a new report, the LLM returns a combined summary and a list of recommended actions.
Day 4: Work on Geocoding and trend analysis. Use Geopy to convert addresses in sample EIDOs to coordinates. Store coordinates in the incident data structure. Implement a simple analysis: for each incident, compute the bounding box or max distance of all associated locations; also globally, compute how many incidents per distinct area or over time. Start preparing visualization data, e.g., incident counts by hour (if timestamps are available in EIDOs). Milestone 4: Able to plot incident locations on a map (using Streamlit’s map component or folium) and a basic chart of incident count over time.
Day 5: Build the FastAPI endpoints to mirror system functions. For example, implement POST /ingest_report which takes JSON, runs the matching, summary update, and returns the incident summary (and whether it was new or updated). Implement GET /incident/{id} to retrieve current info about an incident. Also possibly an endpoint GET /incidents to list all active incidents with brief info. Test these endpoints with requests from a client to ensure they work. In parallel, start constructing the Streamlit interface – set up the page layout and add components to display results (but final polish on Day 6). Milestone 5: Back-end functionality is accessible via API, and a rudimentary Streamlit app can trigger the processing of a batch of reports (e.g., by reading from a file or a predetermined list).
Day 6: Finish the interactive UI and conduct integration testing. In Streamlit, add file uploader or text box for new EIDO input, a button to run the analysis, and areas to display outputs: perhaps a table of incidents (with columns like Incident ID, Summary, #reports, recommended action), and a map showing pins for each incident’s locations. Add any visuals for growth trends (e.g., a line chart for number of reports vs. time). Ensure that when a new report is ingested via the UI or API, the UI updates the incident list appropriately. Polish the prompt templates for the LLM if needed to improve the clarity of summaries and action advice. Milestone 6: End-to-end demo: user can input a set of reports and see the agent correctly group incidents, summarize them, and suggest responses on the dashboard.
Day 7: Testing, optimization, and buffer. This day is for refining the system based on test runs. We will simulate various scenarios (e.g., two unrelated incidents vs. two related ones arriving out of order) to see if the agent links and distinguishes them properly. Tune the similarity threshold for incident matching if needed. If the LLM responses are too verbose or formatted incorrectly, adjust the prompts or post-process the output (e.g., parse the LLM output if we instruct it to output JSON for the recommendations). Also, if performance is an issue, consider caching LLM results for repeated runs or reducing model size for demo purposes. Finally, prepare a presentation or documentation within the Streamlit app to guide the demo (like instructions or examples for the user). Milestone 7: The AI agent system is stable and ready for demonstration, with all critical features working within the one-week development window.
Throughout the week, development will be iterative. By prioritizing core functionality first (parsing, matching, summarizing), we ensure the most important pieces are done early, and later days can focus on user interaction and quality improvements. This staged approach also mitigates risk: for instance, if the chosen LLM is too slow, we discover that by Day 3 and can pivot to an alternative solution (like using the API or a smaller model) without derailing the entire project.
Conclusion
In summary, this technical plan details a comprehensive approach to building an AI-driven incident management assistant. By leveraging structured EIDO data and combining it with advanced LLM reasoning, the agent can consolidate multi-source emergency information into actionable insights. The proposed architecture is modular – separating concerns like data ingestion, language understanding, and geospatial analysis – making it easier to develop and future-proof for real-time operation. We have recommended a modern Python tech stack (FastAPI, Streamlit, LangChain, etc.) and cutting-edge open-source LLMs (QwQ and DeepSeek’s models) that align with the project’s needs for reasoning and summarization. The one-week timeline is aggressive but feasible, targeting a functional prototype that can be demonstrated interactively. This prototype will show how incoming 9-1-1 or campus police reports can be automatically fused into a coherent picture, with the AI agent determining when to start a new incident record or update an existing one, summarizing the evolving situation, monitoring the spread of the incident, and even recommending what actions to take next. Such a system has the potential to greatly assist emergency coordinators by reducing information overload and highlighting critical details, all within seconds of receiving new incident data.
