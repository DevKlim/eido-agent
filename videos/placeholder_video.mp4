<!-- This is a placeholder. You would need to create or find a suitable MP4 video file and place it in a 'static/videos/' directory.
For the purpose of this code, I will assume 'static/videos/hero_background.mp4' exists.
A good placeholder video could be an abstract data visualization, network connections, or a subtle, dark, tech-themed animation.
If you don't have one, the CSS has a fallback dark background color.
